# Royalty Enforced NFT

The idea here is to create the most simple NFT standard that enforces creator royalties. This is a proof of concept and very open to feedback.

## Motivation

NFT royalties are a hot topic as of late. Marketplaces such as Magic Eden and DyDx have implemented "optional royalties", and other protocols such as sudo swap circumvent royalties alltogether.

This can be harmful to artists or projects who require royalties to continue contributing to their project / create value for collectors.

While royalties may not be a sound business model for many projects, I do believe artists should be able to enforce royalties originally described in their contract. With current token standards, royalties are merely a suggestion to marketplaces. As marketplaces compete for traders, I believe the royalty race will eventually go to zero.

The community has rightfully pointed out some of the hypocracy of marketplaces too, in that they will often make creator royalties optional, but never their own marketplace fee. This is counter to the web3 ideals of code being law and eliminating rent seekers who extract more value than they create.

## Solution

Marketplaces will always be able to circumvent creator royalties as long as the tokens **allow for non-financial transfers**.

As soon as a token can be transferred without monetary exchange, royalties are out. This is because a third party (a marketplace)
